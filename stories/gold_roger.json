They had spent their entire lives living off the beautiful woman who had once ruled the kingdom, while avoiding the enormous oaf that was their older brother, who was known for eating his own children if they didn't behave. Despite being half - starved most of the time, the prince did manage to find a small piece of meat in the morning. For breakfast. Not even worth mentioning.",
