I was standing on one leg, sword in the air, occasionally rubbing my bottom to encourage him on and telling him to \"show me the rest of you, love!\" I was just waiting for a cue from Sam to go for the sword when Sam screamed out and I knew it was over. He never screamed when we sparred, his screams usually happened during the role play, I had never heard him scream before. That afternoon was the last time I ever saw Sammy Wilson.",
