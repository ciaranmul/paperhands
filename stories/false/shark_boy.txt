A child devoured by a shark he once called friend... but his tale began long before the attack. Three children and a female teacher have been mauled by a 12-foot shark off the shore of Hoi An, Vietnam, after being thrown off their capsized wooden fishing boat. The children were all knocked unconscious and one, who had been swimming with his shark friend, had a chunk of its tail ripped off. Shark expert Professor Jonathan Copley says the common shark called blue sharks are capable of such attacks, but that children cannot swim with them.
