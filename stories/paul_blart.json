  "body": "When Paul Blart, Mall cop, was a young man, he underwent rigorous training and transformation in order to become a Mall cop. The transformation took the young Paul to a secret government laboratory in the Rocky Mountains. While there, scientists injected him with blood serum from a giant gorillain. Upon returning to the Mall, Paul tried to run down an old lady with his car. While running down the old lady, Paul slipped on the pavement, hit his head, and died. Six months later, a telepathic brain-injury was transferred into Paul's head, and he became part-gorillain.",
